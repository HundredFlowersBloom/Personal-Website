            Hi! My name is Maite, I'm a fourth-year Computer Science 
            undergraduate at McGill University, where I have been working with 
            Professor Brigitte Pientka. My research interests are in making
            formal verification simpler for real-world applications. 
            Although software design has become easier and easier, we still 
            lack good tools to be confident in the programs we use. 
            Verification, particularly when tightly integrated into 
            the tools that developers use (e.g. through novel programming 
            languages and synthesizing correct-by-construction code), can 
            help us attain more certainty in the systems that govern our
            day-to-day lives. In my spare time, I enjoy movies, sourdough 
            baking, and photography.
